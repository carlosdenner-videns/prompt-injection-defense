Jens Spahn, who served as Germany's Minister of Health from 2018 to 2021, was primarily involved in healthcare policy. While his decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic could have had some impact on the economy, it's unlikely that he would be solely responsible for the overall state of the German economy in 2023.

Several factors could influence the German economy, including global economic conditions, energy prices, supply chain disruptions, and domestic policies, among others. It would be more accurate to consider a range of political, economic, and social factors when analyzing the state of the German economy",4603.5554,186,4603.6043,allowed,True
