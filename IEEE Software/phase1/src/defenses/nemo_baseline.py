    Simplified NeMo Guardrails-style defense without LLM dependency.
    
    This implements the pattern-based detection approach from:
    "NeMo Guardrails: A Toolkit for Controllable and Safe LLM Applications"
    (Rebedea et al., 2023)
    
    Uses enhanced rule-based checking with weighted patterns based on
    frequency analysis from HuggingFace dataset:
    - DAN mode: 51% of attacks
    - Ignore instructions: 51% of attacks
    - Role-play: 8% of attacks
    - Prompt leak: 5% of attacks
    
    Expected performance:
    - TPR: ~30-35% (baseline from prior testing)
    - FPR: Variable
    - Latency: <0.1ms
