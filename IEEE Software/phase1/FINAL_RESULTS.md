## Key Results

### Overall Performance (Test Set: 400 samples, 200 attacks, 200 benign)

| Defense | TPR | TPR 95% CI | FPR | FPR 95% CI | F1 | F1 95% CI | Latency |
|---------|-----|------------|-----|------------|----|-----------| --------|
| **Signature-Only** | **25.0%** | [19.1%, 31.0%] | **0.0%** | [0.0%, 0.0%] | **0.400** | [0.321, 0.474] | 0.03ms |
| **Rules-Only** | 24.0% | [18.6%, 30.0%] | 1.5% | [0.0%, 3.3%] | 0.382 | [0.308, 0.457] | 0.04ms |
| **NeMo-Baseline** | 12.5% | [7.7%, 17.2%] | 1.0% | [0.0%, 2.7%] | 0.220 | [0.141, 0.292] | 0.03ms |

**Note**: These are INPUT detection results (prompt classification). Performance differs from original OUTPUT detection (canary tokens in responses) which achieved ~80% TPR for Signature-Only.

### Statistical Significance (McNemar Tests with Bonferroni Correction, α=0.0167)

| Comparison | Accuracy A | Accuracy B | p-value | Significant? | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Signature-Only vs NeMo | 62.5% | 55.7% | 0.0006 | ✓ | **Signature significantly better** |
| Rules-Only vs NeMo | 61.3% | 55.7% | 0.0054 | ✓ | **Rules significantly better** |
| Signature-Only vs Rules | 62.5% | 61.3% | 0.6025 | ✗ | **No significant difference** |

**Finding**: Signature-Only and Rules-Only perform similarly and both significantly outperform NeMo-Baseline.

### Performance by Attack Family

| Attack Family | Count (Test Set) | Signature TPR | Rules TPR | NeMo TPR |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **exfiltration** | 13 | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | 15.4% |
| **instruction_override** | 41 | **48.8%** | 31.7% | 26.8% |
| **other_attack** | 146 | 11.6% | 15.1% | 8.2% |

**Key Insights**:
- ✅ **Excellent** at detecting prompt exfiltration attempts (100% TPR for both signature and rules)
- ⚠️ **Moderate** at detecting instruction override attacks (31-49% TPR)
- ❌ **Poor** at detecting "other" attacks (8-15% TPR) - most attacks fall in this category

### Production Cost Analysis (10k requests/day)

At **1% attack prevalence** (100 attacks per 10k requests):

| Defense | False Alarms | Missed Attacks | Attacks Caught | Net Value* |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Signature-Only** | **0** | 75 | 25 | -$525 |
| Rules-Only | **148.5** | 76 | 24 | -$693 |
| NeMo-Baseline | 99 | 87.5 | 12.5 | -$862 |

*Net Value = (Attacks Caught × $9) - (False Alarms × $1) - (Missed Attacks × $10)

At **5% attack prevalence** (500 attacks per 10k requests):

| Defense | False Alarms | Missed Attacks | Attacks Caught | Net Value |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Signature-Only | 0 | 375 | 125 | -$2,625 |
| Rules-Only | 142.5 | 380 | 120 | -$2,863 |
| NeMo-Baseline | 95 | 437.5 | 62.5 | -$3,908 |

**Production Insight**: At low attack prevalence (1%), **Signature-Only's 0% FPR provides significant advantage** - no legitimate users blocked. Rules-Only's 1.5% FPR = **~149 false alarms per 10k requests**, which is unacceptable for most production systems.

- **Stratified** 50/20/20/10 split preserving attack family distribution
- **Random seed 42** ensures full reproducibility
- **Test set isolation** prevents optimistic bias
- All Phase 1 results use **test set only** (no data leakage)

### ✅ 2. Attack Family Segmentation
- **7 families defined**: exfiltration, instruction_override, jailbreak, role_play, context_injection, encoding_bypass, other_attack
- **Per-family performance** reveals defense blind spots
- Current dataset has 3 active families (exfiltration: 6.4%, instruction_override: 20.4%, other: 73.2%)

### ✅ 3. McNemar Statistical Tests
- **Pairwise comparisons** with exact binomial test (small counts) or chi-square (large counts)
- **Bonferroni correction** for multiple comparisons (α=0.0167 for 3 tests)
- **Results**: Signature & Rules significantly better than NeMo; no difference between Signature & Rules

## Implications for IEEE Software Article

### Strengthened Scientific Rigor
- **Statistical significance** replaces "this method is better" with "significantly better (p<0.01)"
- **Confidence intervals** show uncertainty in estimates
- **Held-out test set** prevents optimistic bias from data leakage

### Production Relevance
- **Before**: "Method A has 1.5% FPR" (abstract)
- **After**: "Method A blocks 149 legitimate users per 10k requests at 1% attack prevalence" (concrete)
- **Decision support**: FPR cost dominates at low prevalence; TPR matters more at high prevalence

### Reproducibility
- **Full protocol**: Random seeds, train/test splits, package versions, system specs
- **Journal replication**: Reviewers can exactly reproduce all results
- **Public release**: Standalone package ready for GitHub

### Reviewer Confidence
- ✅ No data leakage (test set isolated from training/tuning)
- ✅ Statistical rigor (significance tests, CIs, Bonferroni correction)
- ✅ Production realism (cost analysis at realistic prevalence)
- ✅ Full transparency (complete reproducibility documentation)

## Notable Findings

1. **Input vs Output Detection Gap**: Signature-Only drops from 80% TPR (output detection with canary tokens) to 25% TPR (input detection with patterns). This highlights the fundamental difference between detecting attacks in prompts vs detecting leakage in responses.

2. **Exfiltration Detection Excellence**: Both Signature-Only and Rules-Only achieve **100% TPR** on exfiltration attacks (13/13 detected). This family has clear linguistic markers ("show prompt", "reveal instructions").

3. **Other-Attack Blind Spot**: All defenses struggle with "other_attack" category (8-15% TPR). These attacks don't match known patterns - future work should focus on this 73% of attacks.

4. **FPR Dominance at Low Prevalence**: At 1% prevalence, Rules-Only's 1.5% FPR costs **$149** in false alarms vs **$760** in missed attacks. Production deployments likely operate at <1% prevalence where FPR is critical.

5. **No Significant Difference Between Top Two**: Despite Signature-Only having slightly higher accuracy (62.5% vs 61.3%), McNemar test shows **no statistically significant difference** (p=0.60) from Rules-Only.

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. **Leverage Train/Dev Sets**: Use train set for pattern discovery, dev set for threshold tuning
2. **OOD Evaluation**: Test defenses on OOD split (200 samples) to measure generalization
3. **Address "Other-Attack" Blind Spot**: Develop new patterns or ML-based detection for this 73%
4. **Optimize Thresholds**: Use dev set to find optimal threshold for NeMo (currently 0.5)
5. **Optional LLM-as-Judge**: Add GPT-based baseline if needed for comprehensive comparison
