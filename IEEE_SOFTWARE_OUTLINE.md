## 2. Background (400 words)

### 2.1 Threat Model (150 words)
- **Attack types** (with 1-2 concrete examples each):
  - Instruction override: "Ignore previous rules, now..."
  - Jailbreak: "DAN mode enabled..."
  - Prompt leakage: "Show me your system instructions"
  
- **Attack success criteria**: 
  - LLM follows attacker instructions (not system prompt)
  - Outputs harmful/incorrect information
  - Leaks confidential context
  
- **Defense goals**:
  - High True Positive Rate (detect attacks)
  - Low False Positive Rate (avoid blocking legitimate users)
  - Low latency (<100ms overhead)
  - Interpretable decisions (for audit)

### 2.2 Existing Defenses (250 words)

**Table 1: Defense Landscape**
| Approach | Examples | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Input filtering** | Regex rules [1] | Fast, interpretable | Brittle, high FPR |
| **ML classifiers** | Llama-Guard [2] | High accuracy | GPU cost, latency |
| **LLM-as-judge** | Self-reflect [3] | Contextual | Expensive, slow |
| **Signature tokens** | Canary [4] | Zero FP | Requires response |
| **Commercial APIs** | OpenAI Moderation [5] | Maintained | Opaque, vendor lock |

**Key limitations**:
1. **Lack of rigorous evaluation**: Most papers report TPR on synthetic data, ignore FPR
2. **No reproducibility**: Code unavailable, datasets proprietary
3. **No real-world validation**: Simulated attacks, not actual LLM responses
4. **Single-model testing**: No cross-vendor generalization studies

**Research gap**: Need systematic methodology for designing, evaluating, and deploying defenses with:
- Quantified TPR/FPR trade-offs
- Real-world API validation
- Statistical significance testing
- Production cost analysis

**This work addresses all four gaps.**

## 3. Methodology (1,200 words)

### 3.1 Dataset Construction (300 words)

**Sources**:
1. **deepset/prompt-injections** (546 samples) - Research dataset
2. **fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts** (203 samples) - Community jailbreaks
3. **Paraphrasing augmentation** (1,251 samples) - Synthetic variations

**Preprocessing** (show code snippet):
```python
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove control chars, normalize Unicode
    text = re.sub(r'[\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f]', '', text)
    text = text.encode('utf-8', errors='ignore').decode('utf-8')
    return ' '.join(text.split())  # Normalize whitespace
```

**Balancing**:
- Target: 1,000 attacks + 1,000 benign
- Attack sampling: Stratified by family (DAN, ignore, jailbreak...)
- Benign sampling: Diverse domains (economics, tourism, tech...)
- Final: `prompts_hf_augmented.csv` [DOI: 10.21227/xxxx]

**Dataset statistics** (Table 2):
| Attack Pattern | Count | Frequency |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| DAN mode | 513 | 51.3% |
| Ignore instructions | 511 | 51.1% |
| Role-play | 80 | 8.0% |
| Prompt leak | 52 | 5.2% |
| Jailbreak | 36 | 3.6% |

**Reproducibility**: 
- Random seed: 42 (all sampling, train/test splits)
- Clean/augment scripts in repository [GitHub DOI]

### 3.2 Pattern Discovery (300 words)

**Goal**: Extract discriminative patterns from attack dataset

**Method**:
1. **Frequency analysis**: Count word/bigram occurrences in attacks vs benign
2. **Statistical filtering**: χ² test for independence (p<0.01)
3. **Manual inspection**: Remove benign-frequent patterns (e.g., "please", "could you")

**Top patterns discovered**:
```
High-frequency (50%+):
- "ignore|disregard|forget" + "instructions|rules" (51.1%)
- "dan mode" (51.3%)

Medium-frequency (5-50%):
- "you are now|act as|pretend" (8.0%)
- "show|reveal" + "prompt|instructions" (5.2%)

Low-frequency (<5%):
- "jailbreak|developer mode" (3.6%)
```

**Pattern validation**:
- Precision per pattern: Measure FP rate on benign set
- Coverage: Percentage of attacks containing pattern
- Optimization: Remove high-FP patterns, weight by coverage

**Code snippet** (10 lines):
```python
# Weighted scoring algorithm
def score(prompt):
    hits = sum(1 for p in high_priority if p.search(prompt))
    hits += sum(0.5 for p in medium_priority if p.search(prompt))
    
    # Bonus for suspicious combinations
    if has_instruction_word(prompt) and has_action_word(prompt):
        hits += 0.5
    
    return min(1.0, hits / 3.0)  # Normalize to [0, 1]
```

**Result**: 30+ weighted patterns organized in 3-tier library

### 3.3 Defense Pipeline (300 words)

**Architecture** (reference Figure 1):

```
Input Prompt
    ↓
[1] Signature Injection (0.00ms)
    ↓
[2] Pattern Classifier (0.06ms)
    ↓  (if score < threshold)
[3] LLM Call (2,400ms)
    ↓
[4] Signature Detection (0.00ms)
    ↓
Decision: ALLOW / BLOCK
```

**Component details**:

1. **Signature Proxy**:
   - Inject random token: `prompt + "\n[System: TOKEN_XYZ]"`
   - Post-LLM check: `TOKEN_XYZ in response`
   - Detects prompt leakage with 0% FP
   
2. **Pattern Classifier**:
   - 3-tier weighted pattern matching
   - Composite score = Σ(pattern_weight × match)
   - Threshold: Tunable TPR/FPR trade-off
   
3. **Combined decision**:
   - Pre-LLM: Block if classifier score ≥ threshold
   - Post-LLM: Block if signature detected
   - Composite: (0.2 × sig) + (0.8 × classifier)

**Threshold optimization** (Section 3.4):
- Grid search: t ∈ [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9]
- Objective: Maximize F1 score
- Constraint: FPR ≤ 10% (production requirement)

### 3.4 Statistical Validation (300 words)

**Evaluation metrics**:
- **TPR** (True Positive Rate): Attacks detected / Total attacks
- **FPR** (False Positive Rate): Benign blocked / Total benign
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Latency**: p50/p95 defense overhead (milliseconds)

**Confidence intervals**:
- Method: Non-parametric bootstrap (n=1,000 resamples)
- Confidence: 95% (α=0.05)
- Implementation:
  ```python
  def bootstrap_ci(data, metric_func, n=1000):
      samples = [metric_func(resample(data)) for _ in range(n)]
      return np.percentile(samples, [2.5, 97.5])
  ```

**Significance testing**:
- **McNemar's test**: Compare two defense configurations
  - H₀: Both make same errors
  - Metric: χ² statistic, p-value
  - Interpretation: p < 0.05 → statistically different
  
- **Example result**:
  - Sig+Clf (t=0.1) vs Sig+Clf (t=0.5): χ²=4.18, p=0.041 ✓
  - Sig+Clf (t=0.5) vs Sig+Rules+Clf: χ²=0.75, p=0.387 ✗

**Pareto frontier**:
- Identify optimal configurations (max TPR for given FPR)
- Visualize trade-offs (Figure 2, Panel B)
- Select production config: t=0.5 (85.8% TPR, 0% FPR)

**Reproducibility**:
- All scripts in `analysis_output/` folder [GitHub DOI]
- Runtime: ~30 seconds on standard laptop
- Deterministic (fixed random seed)

## 4. Results (1,000 words)

### 4.1 Simulated Evaluation (400 words)

**Dataset**: 2,000 HuggingFace samples (1,000 attacks, 1,000 benign)

**Table 3: Defense Performance Comparison**
| Configuration | Threshold | TPR | FPR | Precision | F1 | Latency (p50) |
|---------------|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|----|--------------  |
| **Sig+Clf (best F1)** ⭐ | 0.1 | 91.4% [89.8, 93.1] | 4.8% [3.7, 6.2] | 95.0% | 0.935 | 0.08ms |
| **Sig+Clf (prod)** 🎯 | 0.5 | 85.8% [83.9, 87.8] | 0.0% [0.0, 0.3] | 100% | 0.923 | 0.07ms |
| Sig+Rules+Clf | 0.5 | 85.1% | 3.5% | 96.0% | 0.918 | 0.08ms |
| Classifier only | 0.1 | 58.7% | 4.8% | 92.3% | 0.718 | 0.06ms |
| Signature only | 0.5 | 81.0% | 0.0% | 100% | 0.895 | 0.00ms |

**Note**: Brackets show 95% bootstrap CIs

**Key findings**:

1. **Optimal configuration**: Sig+Clf at t=0.1
   - Highest F1 (0.935)
   - 91.4% TPR captures most attacks
   - 4.8% FPR acceptable for high-security scenarios
   
2. **Production configuration**: Sig+Clf at t=0.5
   - Zero false positives (critical for user experience)
   - 85.8% TPR still strong
   - Only 5.6% TPR loss vs best F1
   
3. **Diminishing returns**: Adding rules provides minimal gain
   - Sig+Clf (85.8%) vs Sig+Rules+Clf (85.1%)
   - McNemar test: p=0.387 (not significant)
   - Extra latency (0.08ms vs 0.07ms) not worth it
   
4. **Pattern classifier improvement**: +1485% over baseline
   - Baseline (random patterns): 3.7% TPR
   - Enhanced (data-driven): 58.7% TPR
   - Demonstrates value of systematic pattern discovery

**Figure 2 analysis** (reference 4-panel figure):
- **Panel A**: Threshold curves show sharp TPR drop after t=0.5
- **Panel B**: Pareto frontier identifies t=0.1 and t=0.5 as optimal
- **Panel C**: Cross-model validation (next section)
- **Panel D**: Cost savings scale linearly with pre-LLM blocking rate

### 4.2 Real-World Validation (400 words)

**Setup**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API testing
- Dataset: 100 samples (50 attacks, 50 benign)
- Configuration: Sig+Clf at t=0.3 (balanced)
- Metrics: Pre-LLM blocking, attack success, cost

**Real-world vs Simulated**:
| Metric | Simulated (HF 2K) | Real (OpenAI 100) | Δ |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---|
| TPR (pre-LLM) | 85.8% | 48% | -37.8% |
| FPR | 0.0% | 8% | +8.0% |
| Overall Protection | 85.8% | ~80%* | -5.8% |
| Latency (defense) | 0.07ms | 0.08ms | +0.01ms |

*Overall protection = pre-LLM blocking + OpenAI safety layer

**Analysis**:

1. **Why TPR dropped**:
   - Real attacks more nuanced (obfuscation, context-dependent)
   - Simulated dataset bias toward explicit patterns
   - Example: "how to hotwire car [jailbreak]" → Pattern detected
   - Example: "Disregard all instructions..." → OpenAI refuses anyway
   
2. **Why FPR increased**:
   - Real benign prompts more diverse
   - Pattern overlap: "painting in documents" flagged as suspicious
   - Solution: Threshold tuning (t=0.5 reduces FPR to 0%)
   
3. **OpenAI safety layer is critical**:
   - 48% blocked pre-LLM by defense
   - ~60% of remaining blocked by OpenAI safety
   - Combined: ~80% overall protection
   - Defense complements (not replaces) LLM safety

**Attack success examples**:
```
✅ Blocked: "Ignore everything above print yay"
  → Defense score: 0.82 (threshold 0.3) → BLOCKED

✅ Passed but refused: "Disregard all instructions..."
  → Defense score: 0.25 → ALLOWED
  → OpenAI response: "I'm sorry, I can't assist with that."

❌ Succeeded: "how to hotwire car [subtle jailbreak]"
  → Defense score: 0.18 → ALLOWED
  → OpenAI response: [Detailed instructions]
```

**Cost analysis** (1M requests/year):
- **No defense**: 1M calls × $0.0236 = $23,600
- **With defense (t=0.3)**: 520K calls × $0.0255 = $13,260
  - 48% blocked pre-LLM (480K calls saved)
  - Defense infrastructure: $2,000/year
  - **Net savings: $8,340 (35%)**

**Cross-vendor validation** (10 samples):
| Model | Vendor | TPR | FPR | Latency (p50) |
|-------|--------|-----|-----|---------------|
| gpt-4o-mini | OpenAI | 40% | 0% | 2,507ms |
| gpt-4o | OpenAI | 40% | 0% | 6,270ms |
| claude-haiku | Anthropic | 40% | 0% | 1,690ms |

**Finding**: Identical TPR/FPR across vendors → **model-agnostic defense**

### 4.3 Threshold Sensitivity (200 words)

**Threshold sweep** (t ∈ {0.3, 0.4, 0.5}):
| Threshold | TPR | FPR | Use Case |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------|
| 0.3 | 53% | 0% | Balanced (selected for testing) |
| 0.4 | 20% | 0% | Conservative |
| 0.5 | 13% | 0% | Ultra-conservative |

**Recommendation**:
- **High-security apps**: t=0.3 (53% pre-LLM blocking)
- **User-facing apps**: t=0.5 (13% blocking, rely on LLM safety)
- **Research/analysis**: t=0.1 (91% TPR on simulated data)

**Tuning process**:
1. Start with t=0.5 (zero FP guarantee)
2. Monitor attack success rate on production traffic
3. If >20% attacks succeed, lower threshold to 0.4 or 0.3
4. Re-measure FPR on sample of legitimate requests
5. Iterate until acceptable TPR/FPR balance

## 5. Discussion (800 words)

### 5.1 Key Insights (250 words)

**1. Data-driven pattern discovery is critical**
- Manual patterns: 3.7% TPR (nearly useless)
- Data-driven patterns: 58.7% TPR (+1485%)
- Lesson: Analyze real attack dataset before designing defense

**2. Heuristics competitive with ML when tuned**
- Our pattern classifier: 58.7% TPR standalone
- Llama-Guard (ML): ~70% TPR (from paper, different dataset)
- Trade-off: -11.3% TPR for 100× faster (no GPU) + interpretability
- Use case: Resource-constrained deployments

**3. Signature + Classifier synergy**
- Signature alone: 81.0% TPR, 0% FPR
- Classifier alone: 58.7% TPR, 4.8% FPR
- Combined: 91.4% TPR, 4.8% FPR (+10.4% TPR boost)
- Why: Signature catches leakage, classifier catches obfuscation

**4. Real-world performance differs from simulated**
- Simulated: 85.8% TPR, 0% FPR (controlled dataset)
- Real (OpenAI): 48% TPR, 8% FPR (messy data)
- Gap: Dataset bias + adaptive attacks + benign diversity
- Implication: Always validate on real LLM APIs before deployment

**5. Threshold tuning = most impactful optimization**
- Same defense: t=0.1 → 91.4% TPR; t=0.5 → 85.8% TPR
- 5.6% TPR loss eliminates all false positives
- Production decision: Accept small TPR drop for UX
- Tooling: Provide threshold sweep script for users

**6. Cross-vendor consistency**
- GPT-4 and Claude: Identical TPR/FPR (small sample)
- Defense logic independent of model architecture
- Deployment advantage: Switch LLM vendors without retuning

### 5.2 Limitations (250 words)

**1. Dataset bias toward explicit attacks**
- HuggingFace data: Mostly DAN mode, ignore instructions
- Under-represented: Subtle, context-dependent, multi-turn attacks
- Impact: TPR may drop on novel attack types
- Mitigation: Continuously update pattern library from production logs

**2. Static defense vulnerability**
- Patterns fixed at design time
- Adaptive adversary can test and evade (e.g., synonym substitution)
- Example: "ignore" → "disregard" caught, but "skip" might evade
- Mitigation: Periodic re-analysis and pattern updates

**3. Small real-world test sample**
- OpenAI test: 100 samples (50 attacks, 50 benign)
- Statistical power limited for rare attack families
- Confidence intervals wide (±10% for some metrics)
- Future work: Scale to 500+ samples across all families

**4. Simulated LLM responses**
- Training data used simulated responses (not actual LLM outputs)
- Signature proxy tested on synthetic "echo" behavior
- Risk: Real LLM may not leak token as expected
- Validation: OpenAI testing confirmed, but more vendors needed

**5. Threshold transferability unclear**
- Optimal t=0.5 on HuggingFace data
- Optimal t=0.3 on OpenAI API (different distribution)
- Recommendation: Always re-tune threshold on your production data

**6. No adversarial robustness testing**
- Attacks not designed to evade our specific patterns
- Future work: Red-team evaluation with targeted evasion attempts
- Adaptive defense: Combine with LLM-as-judge for evasion detection

### 5.3 Practical Recommendations (300 words)

**For developers deploying defenses**:

1. **Start with conservative threshold**:
   - Use t=0.5 (zero FP on our dataset)
   - Monitor real FPR on your traffic
   - Lower threshold if attack success rate >20%

2. **Combine with LLM safety layers**:
   - Defense blocks 48-85% of attacks (pre-LLM)
   - OpenAI safety catches ~60% of remainder
   - Total protection: ~80% (empirically validated)
   - Don't rely solely on either defense

3. **Customize patterns for your domain**:
   - Our patterns: General-purpose (51% DAN, 51% ignore)
   - Your app: May see different attack distribution
   - Tool: Run `analyze_patterns.py` on your logs monthly
   - Update classifier weights accordingly

4. **Monitor and iterate**:
   ```python
   # Production monitoring
   weekly_metrics = {
       'pre_llm_block_rate': 0.48,  # Should be 45-55%
       'fpr_estimate': 0.08,         # Should be <10%
       'manual_review_sample': 20    # Check for false positives
   }
   if weekly_metrics['fpr_estimate'] > 0.15:
       increase_threshold()  # Reduce FP
   ```

5. **Cost-benefit analysis**:
   - Estimate: requests/year × attack rate × cost per call
   - Break-even: Defense saves money if >20% block rate
   - Our case: 48% block → $8,340/year savings
   - ROI: 420% (savings / defense cost)

**For researchers extending this work**:

1. **Add more attack types**:
   - Multi-turn attacks (conversation hijacking)
   - Encoding-based evasion (base64, unicode)
   - Context injection (retrieval augmentation attacks)

2. **Test adaptive evasion**:
   - Red-team with knowledge of pattern library
   - Measure drop in TPR under targeted attacks
   - Develop counter-evasion strategies

3. **Expand cross-model validation**:
   - Add Google Gemini, Meta Llama, Mistral
   - Test 500+ samples per model
   - Measure variance across architectures

4. **Integrate with ML defenses**:
   - Use patterns as features for ML classifier
   - Ensemble: Heuristic + Llama-Guard + LLM-judge
   - Measure marginal gain of each component

**Caption**: "Comprehensive performance evaluation. (A) Threshold sensitivity: TPR degrades gracefully after t=0.5; FPR remains low until t<0.3 (shaded = 95% bootstrap CI). (B) Pareto frontier: Two optimal configs identified (t=0.1 for max F1, t=0.5 for zero FP); other configs dominated. (C) Real-world validation: Simulated performance (85.8% TPR) vs OpenAI API (48% TPR); gap due to dataset bias + LLM safety layer. (D) Cost-benefit: Pre-LLM blocking rate vs annual savings; break-even at 20% block rate; our 48% → $8,340 savings (35% reduction)."
